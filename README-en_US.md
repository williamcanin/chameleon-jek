## Introduction

**Chameleon Jek**, will be a template for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) built especially for those who want to have a blog and a portfolio with speed, lightness and with greater possibility of color customization.

**Chameleon Jek** will have different colors for customization of appearance:

**Chameleon Jek** will use [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), which gives you greater convenience when opening your page on a Mobile device.

Using tools such as Gulp, Rake the others for their management, dependency creation, and configuration of the **Chameleon Jek**, users and development practitioners will have a much easier time manipulating their project.

At the moment the **Chameleon Jek** DOES NOT have a release date, but will be a project in sight soon.
